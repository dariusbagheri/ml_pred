    This is a minimalist HTML and JavaScript skeleton of the GoJS Sample
    <a href="https://gojs.net/latest/samples/minimal.html">minimal.html</a>. It was automatically generated from a button on the sample page,
    and does not contain the full HTML. It is intended as a starting point to adapt for your own usage.
    For many samples, you may need to inspect the
    <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/blob/master/samples/minimal.html">full source on Github</a>
    and copy other files or scripts.

  <!-- The DIV for the Diagram needs an explicit size or else we won't see anything.
       This also adds a border to help see the edges of the viewport. -->
  <div id="myDiagramDiv" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 400px; height: 400px; position: relative; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><canvas tabindex="0" width="398" height="398" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 2; user-select: none; touch-action: none; width: 398px; height: 398px;">This text is displayed if your browser does not support the Canvas HTML element.</canvas><div style="position: absolute; overflow: auto; width: 398px; height: 398px; z-index: 1;"><div style="position: absolute; width: 1px; height: 1px;"></div></div></div>

    This isn't a truly <i>minimal</i> demonstration of <b>GoJS</b>,
    because we do specify a custom Node template and turn on undo/redo support, but it's pretty simple.
    The whole source for the sample is shown below if you click on the link.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sample sets the <a href="../api/symbols/Diagram.html#nodeTemplate" target="api">Diagram.nodeTemplate</a>, with a <a href="../api/symbols/Node.html" target="api">Node</a> template that data binds both the text string and the shape's fill color.
    For an overview of building your own templates and model data, see the <a href="../learn/index.html">Getting Started tutorial.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the mouse and common keyboard commands, you can pan, select, move, copy, delete, undo, and redo.
    On touch devices, use your finger to act as the mouse, and press and hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu.
    The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that are enabled at that time for the selected object.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a more elaborate sample, supporting grouping and tooltips and custom context menus,
    see the <a href="basic.html">Basic</a> sample.
